let <blank> my opinion <blank> that 's what this site is for .
she did <blank> or anything .
prices are just <blank> retail .
but this place was <blank> economical so the expectation was different .
it smelled and tasted <blank> .
who <blank> , it <blank> have been .
the beer sauce is <blank> at best .
the building itself looks <blank> .
we 've <blank> the cream pancakes as <blank> .
i 've never had a <blank> experience than this !
<blank> , i 'm <blank> at a scottsdale club .
if i could give <blank> stars i def <blank> .
<blank> now i 'm really hungry , and really <blank> .
<blank> call , <blank> .
i <blank> i <blank> give <blank> than one star .
the wonton was seriously <blank> filling .
if i could give <blank> stars , i <blank> .
she could <blank> and would <blank> explain herself .
think twice -- this place is a <blank> .
i 'm <blank> one of the <blank> people .
it 's <blank> busy and the restaurant is very <blank> .
even if i was insanely drunk <blank> i <blank> force this pizza <blank> .
as an arizona native , <blank> to the improv for years .
i got <blank> , <blank> seated pretty quickly , and <blank> color .
so , <blank> treatment and <blank> to help me deal with my condition .
at this location the service was <blank> .
so who do i call to <blank> my <blank> .
<blank> so <blank> that it was the consistency of <blank> fish .
i 'm <blank> in a <blank> otherwise i <blank> .
service was a little <blank> to <blank> with .
<blank> our <blank> show up with another <blank> cup <blank> of water .
the food was so-so and <blank> what you get .
i <blank> to <blank> what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
just <blank> back to <blank> the rear tire <blank> and filled .
i <blank> so much <blank> from this ny staple .

the security guard comes upstairs and <blank> on our door <blank> up .
i wanted to like this place but it just <blank> a big <blank> .
i did <blank> know worker there can get <blank> from customer .
and the cleaning is way <blank> .
they make a <blank> name for used car <blank> .
when i was finally there , i was very <blank> .
just a <blank> patty cooked <blank> one .
so <blank> but i <blank> going back any more .
this is the <blank> neighborhood market out of any of them .
the new management team is <blank> !

there are <blank> smiles and <blank> customer service .
when she did <blank> answer him quickly enough <blank> up on her .
the fried rice was <blank> and there was a shit <blank> it .
if your patio is south facing , you 're <blank> of <blank> .

tasted really <blank> , i <blank> believe it .
it is also <blank> for my taste .
food was alright <blank> we <blank> ordered <blank> the mexican menu .
lastly but <blank> least , their brownie desert was <blank> .
it shows that this restaurant has <blank> class .
one <blank> thing after another they do <blank> care to <blank> .
we 've <blank> to this <blank> many times .
my plate looked <blank> except for the <blank> container of cole slaw .

it was <blank> and very <blank> .
i have <blank> received such an attitude toward a <blank> .
the overall prices are <blank> competitive with frys .
too <blank> it <blank> at the <blank> of the other customers .
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm <blank> holding my breath .

it is way <blank> to what they serve !
this is a <blank> college .
my jack and coke was seriously <blank> .
